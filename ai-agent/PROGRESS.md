# openclaw-worklog Agent Progress

## Current State

- Migration state: `ai-agent/` seeded for Hermes project context.
- Repository path: /home/vkleo/.openclaw/workspace/development/openclaw-extensions/openclaw-worklog
- Branch at migration: master
- Had pre-existing uncommitted changes before seeding: yes

## Done

- 2026-05-08: Located repository from OpenClaw project routing table.
- 2026-05-08: Created `ai-agent/README.md` for stable project facts and workflow guardrails.
- 2026-05-08: Created `ai-agent/PROGRESS.md` for ongoing development state.

## Todo

- Inspect project-specific README/config in depth before first real coding task.
- Replace generic command notes with verified install/dev/test/build commands after first successful run.
- Decide later whether legacy OpenClaw bootstrap files should be archived, ignored, or migrated; do not delete automatically.

## Decisions

- `ai-agent/README.md` is the canonical Hermes project context file.
- `ai-agent/PROGRESS.md` records ongoing task/migration state.
- Project `AGENTS.md` is not used as the new canonical Hermes project-agent directory.

## Verification

- `git status --short` was checked before seeding.

## Open Questions / Risks

- Some repositories already had unrelated OpenClaw-era untracked or modified files. Do not auto-commit/push this migration together with those changes without review.
